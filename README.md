Altair HyperLife focuses on fatigue analysis in the time domain, specifically addressing high cycle, low cycle, and factor of safety approaches under uniaxial loading conditions. This software is designed to predict fatigue life under repetitive loadings experienced in various industrial applications. It directly interfaces with major finite element analysis (FEA) result files and offers an embedded material library for comprehensive durability analysis
